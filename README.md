# ConservationMode
A script for conservation mode on Lenovo laptops

# System requirements(subject to change)
You need to have the ideapad_laptop module loaded

# How to use it
First we need to clone the repository, we will use git for that but you can use whatever you want as long as it works
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Florennum/ConservationMode.git
```
Then we change the working directory with
```sh
cd ConservationMode/
```
After that we get ourselves some permissions
```sh
sudo chmod +rwx conservation_mode.sh
```
And finally we execute
```sh
.conservation_mode.sh
```
